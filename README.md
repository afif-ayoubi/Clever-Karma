### User Stories

### Volunteer
- As a Volunteer, I want to receive notifications about upcoming volunteering events, fundraising campaigns, and advocacy initiatives from organizations I follow.
- As a Volunteer, I want to be able to easily access details about the organization, including their location and mission, to decide if it aligns with my interests.
- As a Volunteer, I want to be able to follow organizations to receive future notifications and easily join any live streams they host.

### Organization
- As an Organization, I want to access a comprehensive dashboard that includes real-time data visualizations from multiple sensors deployed in relevant locations (e.g., temperature, humidity, air quality).
- As an Organization, I want the platform to facilitate the sending of targeted notifications to relevant volunteers, outlining the situation and requesting their assistance.
- I want the ability to initiate live streams directly from the dashboard, showcasing the situation in real-time and further engaging potential volunteers who might be geographically dispersed.

### Admin
- As an Admin, I want to have a comprehensive user management system that allows me to send notifications to all users.
- As an Admin, I want the ability to create dedicated sections within the app for specific types of organizations.
- As an Admin, I want to integrate OpenAI capabilities within the platform for functionalities like predicting blood donation needs.

<!-- Tech stack -->

### Coffee Express is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
   - ðŸš¨ Currently, we're working on extending it to cover the entire app!
- To send  notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) with [firebase_messaging](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_messaging) packages which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
- Our app brings geographical contexts to life using the [Google Maps SDK](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation). This integration allows us to display detailed maps, complete with interactive markers for each destination.
- This Project uses NestJs(https://docs.nestjs.com) framework for backend, NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It leverages TypeScript and brings powerful features such as dependency injection, routing, middleware, and more, making it ideal for enterprise-grade development and API integration.
- To enhance user engagement, our app integrates an advanced [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) endpoint powered by the GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct model. This AI-driven feature predicts the most needed type of blood, delivering valuable insights to administrators, who can then notify users via notifications.
- This project integrates data visualization through IoT using [Esp32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32). Sensor data is sent in real-time to Firebase using [real time db](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database), and it is integrated with Flutter using [firebase_database](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_database) package to display graphical representations
