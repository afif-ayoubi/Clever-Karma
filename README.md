### Clever Karma is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
   - ðŸš¨ Currently, we're working on extending it to cover the entire app!
- To send  notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) with [firebase_messaging](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_messaging) packages which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
- The app provides accessibility to start and join live streaming using the [zego_uikit_prebuilt_live_streaming package](https://pub.dev/packages/zego_uikit_prebuilt_live_streaming). This package facilitates seamless integration for live streaming functionalities.
- Our app brings geographical contexts to life using the [Google Maps SDK](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation). This integration allows us to display detailed maps, complete with interactive markers for each destination.
- This Project uses NestJs(https://docs.nestjs.com) framework for backend, NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It leverages TypeScript and brings powerful features such as dependency injection, routing, middleware, and more, making it ideal for enterprise-grade development and API integration.
- To enhance user engagement, our app integrates an advanced [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) endpoint powered by the GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct model. This AI-driven feature predicts the most needed type of blood, delivering valuable insights to administrators, who can then notify users via notifications.
- This project integrates data visualization through IoT using [Esp32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32). Sensor data is sent in real-time to Firebase using [Real Time DB](https://firebase.google.com/docs/database), and it is integrated with Flutter using [firebase_database](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_database) package to display graphical representations

<!-- Prompt Engineering -->
<img src="./readme/title7.svg"/>

### Mastering AI Interaction: Unveiling the Power of Prompt Engineering:

 
### User-Driven Keyword Extraction:
- The journey begins with a tailored questionnaire presented to our users. As they interact with these questions, their responses are meticulously analyzed to extract key phrases and words related to accident data.

### Seamless Prompt Formulation:
- Next, the extracted keywords are skillfully integrated into a carefully crafted prompt.

<img src="./readme/demo/1.png"/>
<img src="./readme/demo/2.png"/>

### Context-Aware Responses from AI:
- Once the prompt, enriched with the user's accident-related keywords, is fed into OpenAI's GPT model, the magic happens. The model processes the input, drawing from its vast knowledge base and the specific context provided. It then generates responses that are not just accurate but also tailored to the user's query.

### Location and Data Integration:
- What sets our application apart is how these AI-generated responses are seamlessly integrated with location-specific data and other relevant information from our app's database. For instance, our historical data includes accident thresholds categorized by season, demographic factors, and location types, enabling precise predictions and recommendations.
