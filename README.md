### User Stories

- As a Potential Volunteer: I want to explore a variety of charity work opportunities (volunteering, fundraising, advocacy) and refine my search using filters (location, cause, skills, time commitment) to find opportunities that align with my interests and availability.
- As Someone Taking Action: When I find an interesting opportunity, I want to see clear details (description, cause, organization, time commitment) and easy participation options (sign-up, donation link, live stream access) so I can get involved seamlessly.
- As a Dedicated Volunteer: I want to follow organizations I care about to receive notifications about new opportunities and stay updated on their work.
- As an Admin: I want to create, edit, and publish a variety of charity work opportunities (volunteering, fundraising, advocacy) on the platform, including clear descriptions, category designations, and participation details.
- As an Analytics-Driven Admin: I want to access analytics that track user engagement with opportunities (views, sign-ups, donations) to understand what resonates with volunteers and optimize future offerings.
- As a Communicative Admin: I want to send targeted notifications to users who follow my organization about upcoming events, new opportunities, and relevant updates.

<!-- Tech stack -->

### Coffee Express is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Flutter app development framework](https://flutter.dev/). Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
  - ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
